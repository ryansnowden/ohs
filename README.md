# Extending Open Health Stack

- Extend [Open Health Stack](https://developers.google.com/open-health-stack) so there are more foundational elements for designing and developing modern but standardized healthcare applications.
- The designs will draw on work already out there, including [Stanford Spezi](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi), but support both iOS and Android platforms, and also web through the use of Material 3.
- It is aimed at product managers and product designers who need to build healthcare apps quickly that focus on function over form.
- Having a highly modular UI library is great but having completed components or whole screens plus a pattern and user journey already created, it will greatly reduce development time.

## Features

Some features will evolve over time as other areas are added. Generally, support will be for iOS and Android first, with web coming later.

Code for each of the sections will hopefully come from other projects and contributors. The default stack should support iOS and Android by default but knowingly an org will have their own, compliant ready infrastructure ready to replace.
