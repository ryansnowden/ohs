# Extending Open Health Stack

- Extend [Open Health Stack](https://developers.google.com/open-health-stack) so there are more foundational elements for designing and developing modern but standardized healthcare applications.
- The designs will draw on work already out there, including [Stanford Spezi](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi), but support both iOS and Android platforms, and also web through the use of Material 3.
- It is aimed at product managers and product designers who need to build healthcare apps quickly that focus on function over form.
- Having a highly modular UI library is great but having completed components or whole screens plus a pattern and user journey already created, it will greatly reduce development time.
